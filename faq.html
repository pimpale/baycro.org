      <h5>Q: What is the purpose of this website?</h5>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">A: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases has all experts worried and has 
        brought the world to a standstill. If the virus continues to spread at the current rate, it is projected that 
        it can potentially result in 100 million cases just in the U.S. The best case scenario for the vaccine’s availability
        is early 2021 and currently no proven medicine to treat it exists; even when this treatment is found, infected patients
        will be treated, but it would not stop the spread until the vaccine is available. Until this time, social distancing 
        serves as the only method of limiting the spread of the highly contagious virus. Therefore, it is not only critical to 
        isolate those who are affected but also those who have potentially come in contact with the affected people.
        Currently, for the general public there is no source for the whereabouts to easily find if they have come in contact 
        with an affected person.</p>

      <h5>Q: Are there any security concerns that come with letting you test your system? Can people enter false data? 
        How do we know your system is secure?</h5>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">A: In order to protect the privacy of the user,the application allows them to erase 
        locations they want to hide, such as their home address. In order to maintain user privacy, individual metrics will 
        not be shown. To take this project one step further, we will focus on ensuring security. In order to reduce the chances 
        of fraud uploads, we will implement google signatures and checksum validation.</p>
      
      <h5>Q: If a user finds out they have come in contact with someone positively tested with COVID-19 what should they do?</h5>
      <p style="margin-bottom:50px">A: The Check Explore Page of this website provides information that informs the user
        what next steps to take, whether it be self-isolation or testing.</p>
        
      <h5>Q: Where do I find my location history?</h5>
      <p style="margin-bottom:50px">A: There are several ways in which you can access your location history. One way is to download 
        your location history from Google. Since all your Google data is toggled on by default, first select "Select None" on the page,
        and then scroll down the page to select Location History from the list. You can also access your location history if you use Google 
        Map. Launch Google Maps, tap the more button (the button with three lines) in the left corner, and lastly tap the timeline to view 
        your location history. Additionally, if you have a Snapchat, you can access your location history ranging from the current day to 40 
        days before.</p>
