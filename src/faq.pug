      h5 Q: What is the purpose of this website?
      p(style='margin-bottom: 50px')
        | A: The exponential growth of COVID-19 cases has all experts worried and has
        | brought the world to a standstill. If the virus continues to spread at the current rate, it is projected that
        | it can potentially result in 100 million cases just in the U.S. The best case scenario for the vaccine&rsquo;s availability
        | is early 2021 and currently no proven medicine to treat it exists; even when this treatment is found, infected patients
        | will be treated, but it would not stop the spread until the vaccine is available. Until this time, social distancing
        | serves as the only method of limiting the spread of the highly contagious virus. Therefore, it is not only critical to
        | isolate those who are affected but also those who have potentially come in contact with the affected people.
        | Currently, for the general public there is no source for the whereabouts to easily find if they have come in contact
        | with an affected person.

        | Q: Are there any security concerns that come with letting you test your system? Can people enter false data?
        | How do we know your system is secure?

        | A: In order to protect the privacy of the user,the application allows them to erase
        | locations they want to hide, such as their home address. In order to maintain user privacy, individual metrics will
        | not be shown. To take this project one step further, we will focus on ensuring security. In order to reduce the chances
        | of fraud uploads, we will implement google signatures and checksum validation.

      p(style='margin-bottom:50px')
