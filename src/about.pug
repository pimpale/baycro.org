        |BAYCRO (Bay Area Youth Coronavirus Relief Organizaion) is an organization consisting of high school 
        |students from the Bay Area dedicated to relieving the stress that Covid-19 has brought onto the 
        |community and the essential workers. We primarily host donation drives to help supply needed 
        |materials to hospitals and local workers; however, we also support monetary
        |donations to directly help the people in need. We achieve this by working together in a student-led
        |environment where we work as representatives for our respective high schools. Our organization hopes to be
        |of assistance for the community and front line workers experiencing the brute of the pandemic.
