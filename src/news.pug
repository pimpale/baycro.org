       h5 Gunn High School drive cancellation, expansion, and more
       p
         | Although we were supposed to have a donation drive at Gunn High School, it was cancelled on the schoolâ€™s
         | order. However, we were still able to collect over a hundred supplies of N95 masks, hand made masks, and
         | face shields. These items will be donated over the coming week to hospitals and elderly homes. In addition,
         | we have also gained new members from multiple schools, and students from Palo Alto High School have also
         | joined.

       h4 Baycro is Now Collecting 3D Printed Supplies
       h5 We have expanded our selection of items to 3D personal protective equipment.
       p
         | We have now expanded the selection of items we accept in donation drives and direct donations. We are now
         | taking 3D printed equipment, primarily face shields, that will now be distributed to hospitals and shelters.
         | If you are interested in printing for us, check out our

         | page. This would not have been possible without Innexgo. A big thank you goes to them for lending us two of
         | their 3D printers as well as other hardware allowing us to get to this stage.
