      p We will be accepting 3D printed face shields and masks, however, please adhere to these guidelines:
      p
        | We prefer that printed parts are made out of the PETG material or other high heat or antibacterial materials.
        | In addition, we prefer if the models printed have been checked by health officials. Examples of these are:
      ul
        li
          a(href='https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/')
            |Prusa Research

      p
        | Depending on the models you print, the supplementary supplies that are necessary will change. Make sure that
        | if you are providing the extra materials, they are compatible with the parts you print.
