                | . Assuming you haven&apos;t disabled this feature, this file will contain your entire location history 
                | since you started your account. As such, it can be rather large. Unzip the file and upload 
                code Location History.json

                | If data is uploaded to our server, we anonymize it to preserve user privacy, and then
                | store it in a MySQL database. We use an Octree with latitude, longitude, and time as the three
                | dimensions in order to detect collisions.

              p.card-text
                | Most data analysis is done client side. Your location history is compared with the
                | location history of people who may have coronavirus, and you will be able to explore locations where you
                | may have been exposed. We use 
                a(href='https://www.openstreetmap.org') OpenStreetMap
                |  to graphically visualize results.
